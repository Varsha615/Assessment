Question 1

# models.py
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
import time

# Define a model
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

# Signal receiver
@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_receiver(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal received for {instance.name}.")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulating a time-consuming task
    print("Signal processing completed.")

# In Django shell or views.py
# Create an instance of MyModel
new_instance = MyModel(name="Test Instance")
new_instance.save()  # This will trigger the post_save signal
print("MyModel instance saved.")
